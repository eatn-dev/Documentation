## Intro

This document provides an overview of the impact our proposed office communication application has on the business process related to locating a colleague within the office. The analysis is based on the perspective of an office worker going through the process, highlighting the challenges they face without the app and how the app simplifies their tasks.

This document focuses on efforts on our **Group project**.

## Existing Business Process Without App 

As an office worker, when you need to find a colleague, the process can be frustrating and time-consuming. Here's what you might typically experience:

Imagine it's urgent, you need to speak with John from the finance department. You're not sure if he's in today, or even if he's free. So, you take the elevator to the floor where John usually sits. You look around, but he's not at his desk. You ask a few people nearby, they aren't sure if John is in today or if he's in a meeting. You wait around, hoping to catch him returning to his desk, or you may need to ask someone for John's number and wait for a response to your message.

This process can take anywhere from 15 to 25 minutes, and that's assuming John responds quickly or is even in the office. 

## Proposed Business Process With App 

Now, let's consider the same scenario with our office communication app in place:

You need to find John urgently. Instead of wandering around, you open the app. You search for John and his profile pops up. You can see he's in the office today and is currently available. You send him a quick "I am looking for you" message via the app. A moment later, the app provides you with John's current location. You walk straight there and have the discussion you need. No more searching, no more waiting.

This new approach typically takes just 2-5 minutes. It's a significant improvement and, moreover, it reduces the uncertainty and anxiety of not knowing whether you'll be able to connect with the colleague you need.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the office communication app is designed to simplify and accelerate the process of locating a colleague within the office, thereby boosting productivity and enhancing the office work experience. By addressing the key pain points in the existing process, the app ensures a smoother, more efficient workflow for all employees.
