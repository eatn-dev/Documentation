## Intro

*You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques.*

### Multiple types of test techniques

*You apply user acceptance testing and stakeholder feedback to validate the quality of the requirements. You evaluate the quality of the design (e.g., by testing or prototyping) taking into account the formulated quality properties like security and performance.*
