## Introduction

As part of my studies in software development, I have gained substantial experience in the implementation of Agile methods during the course of my projects. I have used these methods in both group and individual projects to manage work effectively and deliver results in a timely manner.

## What is Agile?

Agile is a project management and product development approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, customer satisfaction, and high-quality deliverables. It promotes adaptive planning, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible responses to change.

## Tooling

In both the group and individual projects, Jira played a pivotal role as a project management tool. It facilitated the Agile methodologies we adopted, allowing us to track tasks, manage sprints, and monitor the team's progress effectively.

## Implementation in Group Project (GP)

In the group project, my team was tasked by IO Digital to develop a solution which eventually became TrackiO. We adopted an Agile approach to manage the project effectively.

### Weekly Standups

To ensure constant communication and rapid problem-solving, we had weekly standups with our Product Owners (POs) from IO Digital. These meetings were essential for aligning the team with the project's goals, discussing the progress, addressing any blockers, and planning for the next steps.

### Sprint Duration

Our project was divided into sprints of three weeks each. This timeframe allowed us to plan, execute, and review our work in manageable chunks, enabling us to maintain high-quality standards while adapting to any changes or challenges that arose during the project.

### Sprint Review

At the end of each sprint, we conducted a sprint reflection with our stakeholders. These sessions gave us the opportunity to look back at the work done during the sprint, discuss what went well and what could be improved, and make plans for improvements in the next sprint.

### Sprint Kick-off

Before the start of each sprint, we had a meeting with the PO and tech support to discuss what we were planning on doing in the upcoming sprint. These kickoff meetings helped set clear expectations for the sprint and ensure all team members were on the same page.

### Sprint Points System

In the last two sprints of the project, we started using the sprint points system. This tool helped us to estimate the amount of work involved in each task and manage our workload more effectively. 

## Conclusion

Implementing Agile methods in both group and individual projects has not only helped me deliver projects on time but also fostered a continuous learning environment. I have become aware of popular Agile methods, their principles, and how to select the most suitable one based on the project context.
