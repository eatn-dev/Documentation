## Introduction

This portfolio will serve as a guide to my individual project for third semester of FHICT (2022-2023). This repository will act as a summary of my work in this semester, along with explanations and evidence of how I fulfilled learning outcomes for this semester.

Grading system is explained [here](https://fhict.instructure.com/courses/12993/outcomes), but I'll go over it briefly. Grading system is based on proficiency rating of different skills which Fontys deems necessary for real-life work. The ratings range like this: 

- Undefined
- Beginning
- Proficient
- Advanced
  
## Learning outcomes

For a detailed list of learning outcomes, see [here](./docs/learning_outcomes/learning_outcomes.md).
